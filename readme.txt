A very simple, easily customisable image gallery. Uses shortcodes to display your picture gallery and/or slideshow.

== Description ==

No Frills Gallery is a simple image gallery with optional slideshow feature. There are a number of gallery plug-ins for Wordpress, but many
are either too complex, too rigid or too expensive for some developer's needs. No Frills Gallery has been developed for simplicity, but also 
for customisation. Thanks to it's use of shortcodes, which are generated after you have chosen your specific requirements, both the gallery 
and slideshow can be placed anywhere on the site, either in a page or as part of a sidebar, header or any content area via either the standard 
shortcode or PHP's do_shortcode syntax.

The styling has remained purposefully simple, allowing you the flexibility you need to build on your own style. All front-end stylings can be
view in the /css/no-frills.css file. While you can edit this directly, it is not advised as it may be replaced on future plug-in updates.
Instead simply copy the styles inside this css file and add them to your own theme's style.css file. Then customise them to suit your needs.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add images to my gallery =

Click the NF Gallery link from the admin area. Once you've entered your gallery name and description, click the "Add Images To Album" button. Using the standard Media Library, select all your required images. Once added you can re-arrange simply by dragging and dropping each item. Click the "X" in the top-right-hand corner of each image to remove it from the list.

= If I remove an image from the gallery will it delete the image from my website? =

No. The images will remain in your Media Library for use elsewhere on the site.

= How do I view my image gallery =

No Frills Gallery uses shortcodes to display images. First customise your gallery settings shortcode by clicking the "Album Display Shortcode Generator" link in the admin menu. Once ready, click "Generate Shortcode". Your shortcode will be displayed directly below the button. Simply copy it and paste it directly in to any of your Wordpress pages.

= How do I create a Slideshow =

A shortcode is also used to display the slideshow. Click the "Slideshow Shortcode Generator" link in the admin menu, customise your requirements and click "Generate Shortode". Then copy and paste your provided shortcode in to any page.

= Can I have more than one gallery? =

Multiple galleries are supported with No Frills Gallery PRO (http://www.jamestibbles.co.uk/no-frills-gallery-pro). PRO allows unlimited galleries, along with a number of additional features to further customise your gallery for extra features.
